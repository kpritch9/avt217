			<h2>Heather Shaw</h2>
			<a href="http://heathershaw.com/" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				Heather's website makes use of bright colors and interactive design to engage the user.  The website design is simple with no navigation, other than highlighting her work.  
				After scrolling through her work, she has a simple button for contact, and also an about me page and links to her social media. She highlights various creative work and brings focus with her sharp,
				clean site.

			<h2>Mingfei Yang</h2>
			<a href="https://www.1monkeyarmy.com/home" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>
			<p>
				Mingfei highlights the games he has worked on, and has a simple navigation.  He highlights his professional work and personal work separately, and uses his about page to write about himself, but also provide
				a streamlined resume.  With a page designated to contact and an embedded form, he makes it easy to navigate, learn more about himself and his works, and get in touch.

			<h2>Kate Moross</h2>
			<a href="https://www.katemoross.com/" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				Kate's website is playful and fun, slapping you in the face with color right up front.  By contrast, her logo design is a simple, streamlined, single font of her name which helps to bring focus to her works.  
				Kate breaks down her work by type, including  pages for Hand Drawn Type, Geometric, Editorial, and Collaborations.  I enjoy that she calls her "about me" section "Biography" but also think it led me to believe 
				it would be a bit more than the single paragraph she included there.

			</a>

			<h2>Tobias van Schneider</h2>
			<a href="https://vanschneider.com/" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				Tobias' home page is playful, easy to read, and different than the typical graphical grid that often portfolios use to lay out their designs.  His page is designed to scroll and move vertically, which I think
				makes it seamless, but also gives him control of what shows in what order so he can highlight what he considers to be his most successful projects.  However, the tradeoff for this, is that if I as the viewer was
				interested in a specific project or type of project, there's not a good index at a glance that lets me choose what to look at.

			<h2>Brook Perryman</h2>
			<a href="https://brook-perryman.pixpa.com/" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				Brook organizes her portfolio according to media, and uses the hover interaction to convey those groups.  Her contact/resume page embeds her resume directly in the browser while also providing a PDF download.
				I wish she also included a bio or paragraph about herself and a photo--even when writing this paragraph, I had to deduce from the name of her instagram that she was female.  She does put her social media and 
				contact information front and center and keeps the experience streamlined and quick.  Since she has email on her contact page, I think she should also include an icon in her left navigation menu as well.
