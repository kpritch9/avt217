			<h2>Five Guys</h2>
			<a href="http://fiveguys.com" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				The first time you browse to Five Guys site, a browser cookies message pops up and darkens the whole screen with an overlay.  
				It is very aggressive, and more successfully done elsewhere like Elevation Burger where the overlayed banner does not detract from the first impression or intent of the user. 	
				Additionally, they have a visible menu on page load, but also a hamburger menu that firstly, has more items than in the expanded menu and secondly, is not laid out in the same format.  
				The menu should be redesigned to minimize duplication, streamline the experience, and consolidate user action (hamburger menu is left, while expanded navigation items are right).
			</p>
			<p>
				They have a very minimalist site, reinforcing their red color on the landing page, and drive attention to order as the largest section up front.  
				Their menu page is well designed so that when you scroll through their limited menu, an "order" button is conveniently located at the bottom, driving orders.  
				However their actual ordering system is very minimal and does not keep with the branding tone of the rest of the website.

			<h2>Elevation Burger</h2>
			<a href="http://elevationburger.com" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>
			<p>
				Elevation burger puts their mission front and center, identifying what sets them apart from their competition.  However clicking the "read more" link results in a 404 Page Not Found.  
				Their site uses consistent blue colors pulled from or complementary to the blue and white of their logo.
			</p>

			<p>
				They highlight the order button by highlighting it with a lighter blue, but make it easy to find locations, explore franchising options, and view the menu outside of immediately ordering.  
				They provide another link to "Order Online" at the bottom of their menu, which is good placement to drive sales.  
				They also link to nutritional information which may be of interest to their customer base if the target audience is a health-based consumer.

			<h2>Burger 21</h2>
			<a href="http://burger21.com" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				Burger 21 streamlines their navigation menu by using a hamburger menu, but keeping "Order Now" outside of the collapsed menu.  
				Expanding the menu shows good information hierarchy with only four large options that have to do directly with ordering customers, while smaller options provide contact, franchising and career options, as well as what makes us better.
			</p>

			<p>
				Branding is consistent throughout pages, using blocky and flat text, buttons and icons, and their menu is interactive and fun, with options to order now at the bottom of each page of the menu.  
				Photos are consistent and relatively high quality, and they have an instagram feed at the bottom of their home page to show customer engagement.

			<h2>Big Buns Damn Good Bugers</h2>
			<a href="http://eatbigbuns.com" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				The website does a good job of highlighting the different locations and driving traffic to the correct one in one click, by showing both locations up front.  
				However the navigation menu text is very small, 11px, and the menu has a lot of options compared to similar sites, including a "Reston Presale" that isn't clear to me what the link represents.  
				Some of the body text can also be small and may be hard to read.
			</p>

			<p>
				The photos on the website vary in quality, and some could definitely be higher quality and have more consisten lighting.  
				Their order system does not keep branding because it redirects to another site, but is easy to use and identifies upcharges, etc. while providing photographs and links to social media.

			<h2>Smash Burger</h2>
			<a href="http://smashburger.com" target="_blank">Visit Website</a>

			<p>
				Smashburger utilizes the standard color palatte for their color scheme, drawing on black and white with red to highlight.  
				They identify they use cookies in a banner at the bottom of the screen, but the eye still focuses on the navigation menu.  
				The navigation menu distinguishes the "Order Online" button, but the contrast of red and white drew my eye to the other navigation menu items before "Order Online".
			</p>

			<p>
				Their menu is interactive, highlighting beef, chicken, and vegetarian options and gives the user opportunity to order with each item viewed.  
				Their loading menu for orders is an animated burger, a fun interactive detail.  Clicking any "order now" button on the menu page takes you to their generic ordering website.  
				They could streamline this process by taking the user to the item directly for customization, rather than forcing me through the options to re-select the item I've decided I want.
